      The "figure" tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations,
      diagrams, photos, code listings, etc. The "figcaption" tag defines a
      caption for a "figure" element. The "figcaption" element can be placed as
      the first or as the last child of a "figure" element. The "img" element
      defines the actual image/illustration.
