Explication du code qui se trove dans le script de JSAsyncFunction.html:


The code is using async/await syntax. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

async function myDisplay() { ... } - This declares an asynchronous function named myDisplay.

Inside the function, let myPromise = new Promise(function (resolve) { ... }); - This creates a new promise called myPromise. The promise takes a function that contains a single argument, resolve. The resolve function is used to resolve the promise.

setTimeout(function () { ... }, 3000); - Inside the promise, a timer is set to wait for 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds) before executing the specified function.

Inside the setTimeout function, resolve("I love You !!"); - This line resolves the promise and passes the string "I love You !!" to the function that was waiting for the promise to be resolved.

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = await myPromise; - After the timer has completed, this line sets the content of the HTML element with the id "demo" to the value that was passed when the promise was resolved.

Finally, myDisplay(); - This line calls the myDisplay function, which then proceeds to update the HTML content of the "demo" element.

The result of this code is that after 3 seconds, the text "I love You !!" will be displayed in the HTML element with the id "demo".
